      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Founded in Kenya, Odiems Limited is a visionary agribusiness and digital innovation company committed to delivering cutting-edge solutions in agriculture, environment, and rural enterprise. We began with a modest portfolio of farming ventures and digital projects aimed at empowering local farmers and businesses. Today, our operations span across poultry farming (including ornamental birds like geese, turkeys, and guinea fowls), agricultural consultancy, digital tools, and curated blog content to educate, empower, and transform communities.
      </p>

      <p>
        Odiems Limited was born from the desire to merge practical farming with smart information technology. As we observed growing challenges like food insecurity, youth unemployment, poor access to markets, and lack of accurate information, we made it our mission to build something bigger – a company that connects innovation with impact.
      </p>

      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>
        To inspire, educate, and empower agribusinesses and communities through innovative farming practices, reliable information, and transformative technology, while upholding sustainability and social responsibility.
      </p>

      <h2>Vision</h2>
      <p>
        To be the most trusted agritech-driven company in Africa that revolutionizes farming, enables sustainable livelihoods, and bridges the gap between agriculture and modern technology.
